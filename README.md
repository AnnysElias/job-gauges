# Job Gauges
 FFXIV-inspired job gauges for Runescape combat styles. Currently only Necromancy is supported.

 ## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Job Gauges copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/job-gauges/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Job Gauges to work make sure your Runescape settings for buff bar size is set to `small` and that your Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as these settings are required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

## Not Implemented Yet

The following features are planned but have not been implemented yet.

- Force track last 10s of conjure timer
- Adjust size of overlay (sm/md/lg/xlg)
- Toggleable alerts for expired conjures, max residual souls, and above X necrosis stacks - as well as bloat not being re-applied if left inactive for a while
- Option to add different color thresholds for Necrosis stacks (eg: purple for 0-4, orange for 6-10, red for 12) ; color won't be adjustable like before since the app now uses premade images for the overlay.

## Known Issues

- I've had reports of the overlay sometimes flickering for 20-50ms when exiting combat. I believe this is a bug with Alt1 v1.5.6. If anyone is willing to manually update to Alt1 v.1.6.0 and lose all their apps/settings to test this I'd appreciate it.
