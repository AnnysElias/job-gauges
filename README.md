 ## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Job Gauges copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/job-gauges/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Job Gauges to work make sure your Runescape settings for buff bar size is set to `small` and that your Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as these settings are required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

## Known Issues

- I've had reports of the overlay sometimes flickering for 20-50ms when exiting combat. I believe this is a bug with Alt1 v1.5.6. If anyone is willing to manually update to Alt1 v.1.6.0 and lose all their apps/settings to test this I'd appreciate it.
